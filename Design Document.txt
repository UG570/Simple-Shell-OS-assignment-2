Limitations of SimpleShell:
 
Built-in Shell Commands: Commands like cd, exit, etc, that are built into the shell (like bash or sh) cannot be executed with execvp.

Shell Scripts Without Executable Permissions: If a shell script does not have executable permissions set (i.e., not marked as executable with chmod +x), execvp will fail.

Commands Requiring a Shell Context: Commands that depend on shell features (redirection <, >) cannot be directly executed. You would need to invoke a shell to handle these.

Commands That Need Environment Setup: If a command requires specific environment variables or configurations that aren't set in the calling process, it may fail to execute correctly.

Invalid or Nonexistent Executables: If the specified executable is not found in the PATH, or if the command is invalid (e.g., a typo), execvp will fail.

Commands with Specific User Permissions: If the executable requires higher privileges than those available to the calling process (and isn't setuid), execvp will fail due to permission errors.
